"""
Collection of python unit tests
for "adf_utils.use_time_bounds_midpoint".

CAM stamps a monthly average with one end of the interval it covers, and which
end depends on the model version: an older CAM h0 file stamps January with
February 1st.  Anything that then asks which year a step belongs to puts it in
the wrong one, which drops a year from an annual mean and shifts a seasonal
cycle by a month (NCAR/ADF issue #423).

The interval is not in doubt, because the file records it, so the time
coordinate is replaced by the midpoint of the recorded interval wherever files
are opened.  These tests cover which variable is believed, and that files
recording nothing are left alone.

NOTE: these tests import adf_utils, which imports xarray, so they are skipped
in CI, which installs only PyYAML and pytest.  They run in a full ADF
environment.
